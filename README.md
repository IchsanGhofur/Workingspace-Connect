## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3+**
2. **PostgreSQL** (running locally or on a server)
3. **Google Maps API key** (enable the **Maps JavaScript API**, **Places API**, and **Geocoding API** in your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/))
4. **Git** for cloning/forking the repository

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or Fork the Repository**
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arybud/workspace-connect.git
   cd workspace-connect
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables**
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: Must be set so Flask can use it.

- DATABASE_URI: (Optional) If you want to override the default postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/coworking_db.

On Linux/Mac:
  ```bash
   export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   ```
On Windows:
  ```bash
   $env:GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your_google_maps_api_key" 
   ```
4. **Create the Database (in PostgreSQL)**
   ```bash
    CREATE DATABASE coworking_db;   
    ```
Or update the config in app.py if you prefer a different database name 

5. **Load Sample Data**
    ```bash
    python data_load.py
   ```

6. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
By default the application will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000
    
## Usage
